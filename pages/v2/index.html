							<h1>Rational or emotional: </h1>
							<h1>Comparative Study of Human and LLM Pathfinding in the Wikispeedia Game.</h1>
							<p>The project aims to explore and compare the strategies of humans and large language models(LLMs) in the Wikipedia game. The goal of the game is to find the shortest paths between two Wikipedia articles. We will investigate whether LLMs are better at finding the shortest paths than humans in terms of efficiency and whether their strategies for finding paths differ significantly from those of humans. Through these analyses, we aim to explore whether LLMs have a deeper or more superficial understanding of semantics compared to humans and whether the LLMs are more perceptual or rational compared to humans.</p>

									<h2>Human Paths Treemap</h2>
									<p>In order to better understand human navigation patterns, our group created this treemap visualization to analyze the category distribution of articles used in player paths. </p>

									<p style="margin-top: -400px;">The big blocks of Science (24.62%) and Geography (19.95%) tell an interesting story - these are like the popular highways that players love to use when finding their way from one article to another!</p>

									<h2>AI Paths Treemap</h2>
									<p>Similarly, we created this treemap to visualize how AI navigates through Wikipedia articles. Interestingly, the AI shows a pattern quite close to human players - it also heavily relies on Science (27.89%) and Geography (17.59%) articles as its main navigation paths. This similarity suggests that our AI agent has learned to use these broad, well-connected categories much like humans do when finding their way through the Wikipedia network!</p>

									<h2>Box plot</h2>
									<div >
										<p>To compare the efficiency of different navigation approaches, we plotted this box plot showing three key measures: the shortest possible path (blue dots), AI-generated paths (red), and human paths (green). Each line in the plot represents a different article pair. Looking at the spread of the boxes, we can see that while AI paths are generally longer than the shortest possible routes, they tend to be more consistent and often shorter than human paths - suggesting our AI agent has learned to find relatively efficient routes between articles!</p>

									<h2>Closeness Score</h2>
									<div >
										<p>In this graph, we plotted the closeness score distribution for different navigation paths. The three curves show how AI paths (pink), human paths (green), and shortest possible paths (blue) compare in terms of their efficiency. The higher peaks of AI and human paths around 0.0-0.25 suggest that both tend to take similar, moderately efficient routes. However, the blue curve's notable peak around 0.75 indicates that the shortest possible paths are often quite different from the routes that both humans and AI naturally choose - a fascinating insight into navigation behavior!</p>

									<h2>Rank of neighbors</h2>
									<div >
										<p>This graph shows how often AI, humans, and shortest paths use links at different positions on a Wikipedia page. The blue bars (shortest path) have a very high peak near rank 0, meaning the most efficient paths often use links found at the beginning of articles. Both AI paths (pink) and human paths (green) follow a similar pattern but with lower peaks - this suggests that while they also tend to use early links, they're more likely to explore links found further down the page. </p>

							<h2>Prompt</h2>
							<p>Our team noticed a key problem in earlier tests: the AI would sometimes try to use links that didn't actually exist on the current Wikipedia page. This was happening because the AI, with its broad knowledge, would think of logical connections between topics but didn't stick to using only the links that were actually available.
								To fix this issue, we created a two-part prompt:</p>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Generally:</h3>
									<p>You are an expert in navigating articles. Your goal is to find the path as short as possible from the start article to the target article by selecting the provided links. You can also return to the previous article by replying 'back'. Please reply only with the name of the article you want to move to, with no explanation or marks.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
									<h3>Specifically:</h3>
									<p>The following reasoning steps may be helpful: 
										<br>
										1. Identify which of the available links might lead you closer to the target topic. 
										<br>
										2. Consider the relevance of each link to the target. For instance, if the target is related to a particular domain, links that share that domain are likely. 
										<br>
										3. If none of the links seem directly relevant, pick the one that might connect you to a more central or well-connected topic.</p>
