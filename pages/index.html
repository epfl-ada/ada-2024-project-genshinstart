              <h2>Welcome to Wiki City!</h2>
              <p>
                Welcome to Wiki City, a metropolis of knowledge where navigating through ideas can feel like exploring a maze. Humans often rely on intuition and personal experience to find their way, but could an AI companion, like a Large Language Model (LLM), chart a faster, more efficient path?              </p>
              <p>
                To explore this, we turn to a game called Wikispeedia. Players start at one Wikipedia article and attempt to reach a target article, moving only through hyperlinks. By comparing how humans and LLMs navigate under these constraints, we aim to discover who performs better and learn how to enhance AI companions.

               </p>

              <p>Wait! Before the official start of the game, we need to make sure our AI challenger understands the play

              </p><p>
                We gave the AI a guidebook called <b>'prompt'</b> which includes clear rules and instructions, allowing
                it to avoid irrational mistakes.</p>
              <p> Our AI challenger's name is <b>GPT-4o mini</b>, a lightweight yet powerful and experienced AI tool, eager
                to prove itself against natural human instinct.
              </p><p>
                The content of the rulebook is in the following. In order to prevent GPT from taking advantage of its prior knowledge on Wikipedia, we did not directly include any information related to Wikipedia during the race (Although in controlled trials it had little effects).</p>

            To make the competition fair and reasonably balanced, we excluded portions of the paths only
travelled by few people. Thus, we have <b>159</b> pairs of a start and a target article the participants
(human or AI) must find. These (source, destination) pairs appear more than <b>10 times</b> in the navigation
patterns of humans

            Equipped with these herculean tasks, our GPT-4o mini now has to take on the challenge and find
            the target article while navigating the maze of knowledge that is Wiki City. To be sure that it is
            actually good, our AI companion has to do this <b>5 times</b> for each of the 159 pairs.
            While this may sound expensive, generating such a dataset is only <b>0.8 dollars.</b>

                  <h3>Path Length Comparison</h3>
              
                  <p>
                    The most basic metric of the game is the length of the paths (including
                    backtracking) to measure how far the traveller (human or AI) will walk until they arrive at their
                    destination.
                  <p>  
                    The average path length for ai, human, and shortest paths are 6.22, 6.65, and 3.70 respectively. Our mighty AI companion was indeed faster than humans on several topics but on others it took a much longer path instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What are the reasons that lead to these differences? Are there potential approaches to improve our AI to find shorter paths based on our analysis.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Closeness score distribution</h3>
                  <p>
                    To gain more details, we next considered a measure that evaluates how each step advances
                    towards the destination in a semantic space. Semantic here means how close the neighbour-
                    hood where the traveller is now is compared to the final destination in Wiki City.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For each transition (current node, next node, destination) the score is given by the following formula:
                  </p>

                    <p>
                      \( \cos(\text{embedding}(\text{nextnode}), \text{embedding}(\text{destination})) 
                      - \cos(\text{embedding}(\text{currentnode}), \text{embedding}(\text{destination})) \)

                    We computed the closeness score for all pairs of nodes for human paths, AI paths, and shortest paths. What's interesting is that both human and machine are actually not so different from each other.

                    This seems to suggest that humans and GPT share the same strategy: semantically approach the destination gradually, whereas the optimal path can find the "key step" to quickly reach the destination.

                    This means that both humans and AI take moderately efficient paths navigating the streets
                    of Wiki City, and that there might exist some shortcuts or other routes that neither humans
                    nor AI would choose naturally - a fascinating insight into navigation behaviour!
                 
                  </p>

                  <h3>First Step Choices in Relation to Step Lengths</h3>
                  <p>Having explored the overall navigation strategy, let us now focus on the details of the initial
                    steps of the journey, examining how the initial choices set the tone for the entire path forward.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We divided the paths into "good" and "bad" groups according to their lengths, and compared
                    the closeness score and out-degrees for the first steps for different groups: 
                    <br>
                    <b>                    ai good, human good,
                      optimal, ai bad, human bad. </b>
                      <ul>  
                        <li> <b>AI Good Paths:</b> Shorter or equal to the average AI path length; stores node degrees and closeness scores.</li>
                        <li> <b>AI Bad Paths:</b> Longer than the average AI path length; stores node degrees and closeness scores.</li>
                        <li> <b>Human Good Paths:</b> Shorter or equal to the average human path length; stores node degrees and closeness scores.</li>
                        <li> <b>Human Bad Paths:</b> Longer than the average human path length
                        ; stores node degrees and closeness scores.</li>
                        <li> <b>Optimal Paths:</b> Shortest paths used as a benchmark; stores node degrees and closeness scores.</li>
                      </ul>

                      </ul>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The results show that compared to longer paths, shorter paths
                    tend to select:
                    <ol>
                      <li><b>Articles with higher out-degrees</b></li>
                      <li><b>Articles with higher closeness scores</b>
                    </ol>
                    Also, AI tends to focus more on semantic meanings while humans select their
                    first steps to have more out-degrees.

                  <h3>Getting Deeper into Semantic Proximity</h3>
                  <p>We go further into the semantic relationships for the choices made by humans and AI, since without so
                    much knowledge of the graph, semantic meanings is definitely one of the few clues that one could rely
                    on to make the navigation. We enlarge our observations, measuring every steps’ every neighboring
                    nodes’ semantic distance to the target. For each node, we rank their neighbors according to their
                    semantic distance to the destination, and it turned out that nearly half of the choices are made to
                    select the semantically optimal choice among their neighbors. Again, the shortest paths have the
                    strongest tendency for this result. Also, AI beat humans in this semantic measurement: a greater
                    proportion of selections are made on the rank 1 neighbor than the others, although the proportion for
                    selecting the top 5 neighbors both slightly exceeded 60</p>
                    
                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                  <h3>The accumulated frequency of rank of chosen neighbor</h3>
                  <p>
                    Beyond semantics, let us focus on another dimension: how the structure of Wiki City intersections affects navigation decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We used the accumulated frequency of rank of chosen neighbour, which can show some
                    strategies of the paths chosen.
                  </p>
                  <div style="height: 500px;">
                    <iframe loading="lazy" data-src="./accumulated_distribution_of_rank_of_neighbors.html" style="

                    transform-origin: top left;
                    transform: scale(0.8) translateX(21.5%);
                    overflow: hidden;"></iframe>
                   </div>
                   <p>
                    As a result, the figure shows that the GPT tends to choose nodes semantically closer to the
                    destination than humans. However, the shortest paths show a lower preference for neighbours with a rank of 3, which indicates that semantically closer may not mean graphically
                    better performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In other words, going into a street in Wiki City that is semantically more similar to the
                    destination can help, perhaps there are other, counter-intuitive routes the traveller can take
                    that actually take it faster to the destination. As the semantic closeness is not the whole
                    story, we need to go a step further.
                  </p>


                  <h3>The accumulated frequency of rank of chosen neighbor's degree, conditioning on low simi
                    larity with destination</h3>
                  <p>
                    While travellers stand at intersections and cannot find a direction semantically similar to
                    the destination, it might be a good opportunity to go to a location that connects to more
                    locations to have a better diversity of options.
                  </p><p>
                    Inspired by this, we plot the graph of the accumulated frequency of rank of the chosen
                    neighbour's degree, conditioned on low similarity with the destination.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                  Until now, we have shown that both the out-degrees and semantic distance to the target are significant
                  factors to make a good navigation decision. But what are their relationships? What if there doesn’t exist a
                  neighbor that is semantically ”close” to the target?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Here, we measured the choices based on the out-degrees conditioned on all the neighbors have low similarity 
                    with the destination. For nodes where all the neighbors have similarity less 0.30 with the destination, 
                    we ranked the out-degrees of all neighbors, and counted the accumulated frequencies versus the ranking. 
                    Although the selections for the top 5 nodes are close for
                    the three groups, shortest paths start to lead the game later.    
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Almost 70% of nodes on shortest paths
                    will select top 10 neighbors in the out-degrees when there is no semantically ”good” choices, while
                    humans and AI have only 50%. 
                    
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    AI and humans perform roughly the same for the top 13 neighbors,
                    but humans rarely choose neighbors ranked beyond 20. We attribute this phenomenon to the fact
                    that nodes with less out-degrees are generally less common concepts, and due to the vocabulary and
                    knowledge differences, humans are less familiar with those choices and therefore not selecting them.

                      <p><b>TextGrad</b> is a framework that enables automatic "differentiation" via text and can be applied to prompt optimization by 
                        designing an appropriate loss function. However, the approach we previously used to generate paths is not well-suited for TextGrad. 
                        One challenge is defining the "ground truth," as there are often multiple shortest-length paths. Even if a ground truth path is decided, 
                        it can be difficult for GPT-4o to generate effective feedback. This is because the optimal path might deviate significantly from the generated path,
                         making it hard to provide feedback on the correctness of each step. The only step that can get accurate feedback is the first step that is different from the optimal path.</p>

                        <p>To address this, we redefined the task for GPT. The input now consists of a pair: [current article] and [target article],
                           along with the available links [neighbors]. GPT is tasked with outputting its [choice]—the next article it prefers to select—and [reason]—an explanation for its choice. This redefinition 
                           allows GPT-4o to provide more precise feedback. We define [all possible first steps in optimal paths] as the ground truth. If the model selects any article from this set, it is considered 
                           a correct solution. For training, we sample a pair from the graph and extract the neighbors as training data.
                           <br>
                        With this setup, the average path length is directly reduced and more stable compared to before, this is probably because the [reason] part ask model for explanation. 
                        which leads to a more accurate inference. But this modification also leads to some failure cases, because sometimes GPT selects infeasible nodes, and we can't correct them like before.</p>

                      <p>
                        For clarity, let’s refer to GPT-4o Mini as the ”student” and GPT-4o
                        as the ”teacher.”
                        </p><p>
                        The initial prompt is:
                      </p><p>
                        You are an expert in navigating articles. Your goal is to find the path as short as possible from the
                        start article to the target article by selecting the provided links. Each time you will be given (current
                        article, destination) pair and the the next article that you could choose.
                      </p><p>
                        Your output should include: ”Choice: ” followed by the title of the article you want to navigate
                        to. ”Reason: ” followed by the reason why you chose that article.
                      </p>
                        <p>Consider multiple potential paths and evaluate their merits before making a choice. Use the information provided and avoid relying on assumptions or external knowledge not present in the task. Reflect on your choices and learn from any mistakes to improve your navigation strategy. Emphasize the importance of minimizing steps and prioritize links that are part of the shortest path. Incorporate feedback from past decisions to refine your strategy and ensure efficient navigation.</p>

                          <p>The core reason for GPT's failure to find the optimal path is that semantic similarity does not necessarily imply proximity in the graph structure. The embedding level distance is not significantly correlated to the graphical distance. This issue applies to humans as well. Our experiments and GPT's responses show that both GPT and humans tend to rely on similar reasoning processes for navigation in the articles. Unfortunately, these processes are fundamentally not optimal for this task.</p>

              <p>
                As you can see, traveller, you are not obsolete yet. The scary AI is still not much better than tested
                human intuition. In fact, you are both quite bad compared to the optimal shortest paths. Since the
                GPT-4o mini is based on data generated by humans, it tries to mimic the suboptimal human reasoning.
                Both humans and AI try to follow a path to the destination in Wiki City where each new street or
                intersection is semantically closer to the target article. But the shortest path can only be reached by
                choosing locations not only based on semantic similarity - something AI in particular is focusing a lot
                on.              
              </p>
              <p>
                Analysis of previous results suggests that a more 
                effective strategy, particularly for the first step, 
                is to choose intersections that connect to a larger 
                number of destinations, even if they aren't semantically 
                similar to the target. Further research is needed to 
                develop an optimal GPS for Wiki City - 
                the city of knowledge."
